If one set of RNA-seq samples consistently has twice the sequencing depth compared to another set, you should account for this difference in sequencing depth during the normalization process in DESeq2. Here's how to handle it:

### 1. **Incorporate Size Factors (Normalization)**
DESeq2 uses size factors to normalize for differences in sequencing depth across samples. By default, DESeq2 estimates these size factors automatically using the median ratio method. This method adjusts for differences in library size (sequencing depth), so you don't need to manually scale the counts.

**What to do:**
- Run DESeq2 as usual, and it will automatically account for the differences in sequencing depth through size factor estimation.

```r
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts,
                              colData = coldata,
                              design = ~ condition)
dds <- DESeq(dds)
```

- After running `DESeq()`, you can inspect the size factors:
```r
sizeFactors(dds)
```
This should reflect that the samples with twice the sequencing depth have roughly double the size factor.

---

### 2. **Explicitly Set Size Factors (Optional)**
If you want to manually account for the 2x depth difference (e.g., to explicitly reflect known biases), you can set the size factors directly:

```r
sizeFactors(dds) <- c(rep(1, n), rep(0.5, m))
```
Where `n` and `m` represent the number of samples in the high and low sequencing depth groups, respectively.

---

### 3. **Why Not Direct Scaling?**
- Directly scaling the counts (e.g., dividing by 2) can introduce biases and violate assumptions of count-based models.
- DESeq2’s normalization using size factors maintains the integrity of the model while adjusting for depth differences appropriately.

---

### 4. **Diagnostic Checks**
- Use PCA plots and MA plots to ensure the normalization is working as expected. Large discrepancies between groups post-normalization might indicate the need for further corrections.

```r
vsd <- vst(dds, blind = FALSE)
plotPCA(vsd, intgroup = "condition")
```

---

### Summary
- **Do not manually downscale counts**. Use DESeq2’s built-in normalization through size factors.
- Optionally, explicitly assign size factors if you have precise knowledge of the depth differences.
